        <h1 class="underline">Introduction to HTML</h1>
        <p>
            HTML (<span class="bold underline">H</span>yper <span class="bold underline">T</span>ext <span class="bold underline">M</span>arkup <span class="bold underline">L</span>anguage) is the code that is used to structure a webpage and its content. For example, content could be structured within a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points or using images and data tables.

        <h2 class="underline">So what is HTML?</h2>
        <p>
            HTML is a <strong>markup language</strong> that defines the structure of your content. It consists of a series of elements which you use to enclose, or wrap different parts of the content to make it appear or act a certain way. For example, if we wanted to make a line to stand by itself, we could specify that it is a paragraph by enclosing it in paragraph tags:
        </p>

        <img 
            src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/HTML_basics/grumpy-cat-small.png"
           alt="Anatomy of an HTML element"
            width="500"
            />
        <p>The main parts of an HTML element are as follows:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <span class="underline"><strong>The opening tag:</strong></span> This consists of the name of the element (e.g. p), wrapped in opening and clsoing angle brackets. This states where the element begins or starts to take effect.</li>
            <li>
                <span class="underline"><strong>The closing tag:</strong></span> This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. This states where the element ends- in this case where the paragraph ends.</li>
            <li>other</li>
        </ol>
        <h2 id="html-summary-heading">Summary</h2>
        <p>
            HTML is a markup language used to describe the structure and content of a webpage, it says what content should be on a webpage. An HTML document is made up of a series of elements. Some elements we covered in this lesson are...
        <ul>
            <li>Heading tag(s)</li>
            <li>Paragraph</li>
            <li>List tags</li>
            <li>Image</li>
            <li>Hyper references (link)</li>
        </ul>
